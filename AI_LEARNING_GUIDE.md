## Learning Velocity Maximization

### Daily Learning Routine
1. **Morning Deep Dive** (30 minutes)
   - Ask AI to explain one core concept in depth
   - Request code examples and explanations
   - Build a small test to validate understanding

2. **Implementation Support** (Throughout day)
   - Use AI for code generation and debugging
   - Ask for alternative approaches when stuck
   - Request optimization suggestions

3. **Evening Review** (20 minutes)
   - Ask AI to review your day's code
   - Request feedback on architecture decisions
   - Plan next day's learning objectives

### Effective Prompt Patterns

#### The "Explain-Then-Code" Pattern
```
"First, explain how [concept] works in Unity, then show me a complete code example"
```

#### The "Problem-Solution-Alternative" Pattern
```
"I need to [solve problem]. Show me the best solution, then give me 2 alternative approaches"
```

#### The "Code Review" Pattern
```
"Review this Unity script and suggest improvements for performance and readability: [code]"
```

### Advanced AI Utilization

#### Architecture Design
```
"Design a scalable architecture for a multiplayer FPS game with these features: [list features]"

"What design patterns are most useful for Unity game development?"

"How should I structure my code to make it easily testable and maintainable?"
```

#### Rapid Prototyping
```
"Generate a quick prototype script for [feature] that I can test immediately"

"Create a minimal viable implementation of [system] that I can expand later"
```

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Networking Challenges
- **Problem**: Objects not synchronizing properly
- **AI Prompt**: "Debug this Unity Netcode synchronization issue: [describe problem]"

### Performance Issues
- **Problem**: Game runs slowly with multiple players
- **AI Prompt**: "Optimize this Unity multiplayer code for better performance: [paste code]"

### Architecture Confusion
- **Problem**: Code becoming messy and hard to maintain
- **AI Prompt**: "Refactor this Unity script using proper design patterns: [paste code]"
