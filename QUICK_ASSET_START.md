# 🚀 Quick Asset Setup - Get Started in 5 Minutes!

## Current Status ✅
Your Hamster Hunter game is now **asset-ready**! It will:
- ✅ Try to load 3D models, textures, and audio
- ✅ Automatically fallback to geometric shapes if assets are missing
- ✅ Display helpful console messages about what's loading
- ✅ Work perfectly fine without any assets

## 1. Test the Current System (1 minute)

1. **Start your game**: `npm run dev`
2. **Open browser console** (F12)
3. **Look for these messages**:
   - `📦 Loading game assets...`
   - `🎯 Using fallback geometry for acorn_shooter` (expected)
   - `🎯 Using procedural environment (no custom map found)` (expected)
   - `🎯 Using fallback green color for ground` (expected)

## 2. Add Your First Weapon Model (2 minutes)

### Option A: Download from Sketchfab
1. Go to https://sketchfab.com/
2. Search for "cartoon gun" or "cute weapon"
3. Download a free model as GLB format
4. Save it as `assets/models/weapons/acorn_shooter.glb`

### Option B: Quick Test with AI (Recommended)
1. Go to https://meshy.ai/
2. Create account (free)
3. Prompt: "cartoon acorn gun, cute hamster weapon, low poly"
4. Download as GLB
5. Save as `assets/models/weapons/acorn_shooter.glb`

   - `🏗️ Created 15 obstacles with textures`

## 5. What You'll See

### Before (Fallback):
- Simple colored boxes for weapons
- Plain green ground
- Random colored obstacles

### After (With Assets):
- Actual 3D weapon models
- Textured ground that tiles
- Realistic-looking obstacles

## 🎯 Priority Asset List

**Start with these for maximum visual impact:**

1. **One weapon model** → `assets/models/weapons/acorn_shooter.glb`
2. **Grass texture** → `assets/textures/grass.jpg`
3. **Gunshot sound** → `assets/audio/weapons/gunshot.mp3`
